# Daily journal

I've decided to start a journey to reinvigorate my technical skills. 

Day 1.

I think its time to learn React. Increasingly I find myself in need of things that could be really great simple web apps. Also, Esri does a lot of work with web, so this could be a great opportunity to explore more of the stack. 

## Getting started

In a few of my past attempts to learn a new framework or technology, I've skipped over the doc and started with blogs. Having worked on doc and samples for almost two years, I think I owe it to the authors to give the traditional approach a try. I'm starting with the React tutorial tonight. 

### Thoughts, discoveries, notes

* I've used NPM before but had never heard of `npx`. It can execute as well as retrieve packages, so you can type `npx create-react-app app` to create a react app without installing - all one line.
