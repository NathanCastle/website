## Welcome to my website

I'm not searching for a job right now, so I'll be focusing on content than rather than trying to dazzle you. 

### Projects

See [GitHub](https://github.com/NathanCastle).

### Blog Posts

I used to have a blog. I'm not in a place in my life where I have a lot of time to blog. Below are archived copies that I'm keeping around in case they're useful:

* [Building the Windows Research Kernel (NT 5.2) on Windows 10](building-wrk-windows-10.md)
* [Diving into the Windows NT Kernel](diving-in-to-the-windows-kernel.md)
* [Redefining the Windows Desktop Experience... with Linux](redefining-windows-desktop-with-linux.md)
* [Thoughts on life without Bootstrap](thoughts-on-life-without-bootstrap.md)
