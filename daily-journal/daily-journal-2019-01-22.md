# Daily Journal

I started today at about 5:45 by finishing up the React docs I started over the weekend.

I wasn't sure what to do next. I felt moved to revisit linear algebra, so I fired up Khan academy and am starting that course.

For obvious reasons, most notes are going to go in a physical notebook rather than here. 

## Learning notes - linear algebra

* Video: Vector intro fo linear algebra
  * Vector: has magnitude and direction
  * Each value in the typical vector notation is the magnitude in one dimension
* Video: Real coordinate spaces
* Video: Adding vectors algebraically & graphically
  * Just add individual components
* Video: Multiplying a vector by a scalar
  * Just multiply each component by the scalar
* Video: Unit vectors intro
  * Unit vectors move one in only one dimension
  * Any vector can be represented as the sum of scaled unit vectors
* Video: parametric representations of lines

Note: had to leave while working on Practice: Add vectors: magnitude & direction to component
